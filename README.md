# Beacon

_Light up your location to friends in your area_

## Imagine...

You get out of a class or are traveling in a new place. You're looking to either hang out with your friends or meet some new people. Normally, you would have to have a group chat, ask your friends to meet you, and message anyone you can think of. Maybe you remember everyone, maybe you don't. If you're looking to meet new people, you'll have a hard time reaching out.

**Instead, light a Beacon.**

Lighting a Beacon is a quick and easy way to let other interested people in a topic know you are in the area and looking to meet up. If you subscribe to a hashtag, you will receive notifications any time someone lights a Beacon near you under that tag. This is a great way to bring you, your friends, and potential friends together when the opportunity arises.
